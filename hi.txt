Introduction
*Nutanix Objects™ (Objects) is a software-defined Object Store Service. This service is designed with an Amazon Web Services Simple Storage Service (AWS S3) compatible REST API interface capable of handling petabytes of unstructured and machine-generated data. Objects addresses storage-related use cases for backup, and long-term retention and data storage for your cloud-native applications by using standard S3 APIs. You no longer have to introduce an external, separately managed storage solution.
